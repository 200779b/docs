# Claim Creator Web UI

## Intro

CPM has many advanced claim types and reset regions funcionality. All those areas can be created with consolecommands. For ease of use CPM has a built in claim creator.
With this Web UI its very easy to create advanced claims or mark regions for reset. Just draw the area and click your way through creating claims.

To access the Claim Creator Web UI just add one to the port you are using to access allocs webmap.
So if you are using http://serverip:8082 to access allocs webmap, you add 1 to that port and thus access CPMcc with http://serverip:8083
