# Getting started

CSMM can be installed on your own server in several ways. These methods are sorted from easy to hard. 

::: warning
CSMM can be installed on Windows, but since I (Catalysm) do not use Windows, I cannot provide any official support for it. If you do want to install CSMM on Windows, be prepared for a lot of troubleshooting.
It might be easier to install a Linux VM ðŸ˜‰
